Rental Car System: Utilizing SDA, Java, and JavaFX Concepts
Introduction:
This report explores how Software Design and Architecture (SDA), Java, and JavaFX can be used to create an effective rental car system.

Software Design and Architecture (SDA):
Modular Design: Divide the system into logical modules for better organization and reusability.
Layered Architecture: Implement a clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers.
Dependency Injection: Utilize frameworks for loose coupling between components.
Java:
Object-Oriented Programming: Model system entities as classes and objects.
Database Connectivity: Integrate seamlessly with databases for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Exception Handling: Handle runtime errors effectively for a robust system.
JavaFX:
UI Design: Create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces with a comprehensive set of UI controls and layouts.
Event Handling: Capture and process user interactions for seamless navigation and data manipulation.
Data Binding: Establish a connection between UI components and data models for consistent data representation.
